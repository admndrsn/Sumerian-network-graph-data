### NOTES ###
### 1. I noticed that some nodes were not merged together since they had different professions
### but one of the differing professions was "None". Could they possibly be the same person?
### --- we need to look at the year for this
### 2. Inspect this text: 126272, for some reason there are many edges going back to the same node
### --- this is a text with multiple transactions with a person involved in multiple transactions

### 1. I only looked at transactions with 2 or 3 people involved this week
### --- 4 or more people involved made the edge creations too complicated, may have to look at them case by case to learn how to split them


### TODO ###
### 1. Take out edges refering to texts with multiple transactions (DONE)
### 2. Work on creating DIRECTED graphs, with the edge format we know how to deal with (DONE)
### 3. Create some graph statistics (mainly eigenvector centrality)
### 4. Perhaps break up with file so that nodes are only created once elsewhere (DONE)
### 5. Perhaps figure out a way so that the id of nodes isn't different each time of creation
### 6. Acquire 10-16 multiple transaction texts, and then send to Harini (DONE)
